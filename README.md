# ReScript Entity

This is a functor that facilitates [name equivalence](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~mmorenom/CS447/Lectures/TypeChecking.html/node3.html) when loading data for an entity type with a unique `string` id, likely a UUID. The repo was created from a template based on the official ReScript [starter template](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-project-template).
